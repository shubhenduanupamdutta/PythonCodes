# This has my Day68 codes for 100 Days of Code, Python Bootcamp by Angela @AppBrewery
# As usual I have used latest code as on March 2023.
## This time I have also done a few things different, I have many times used try and except then if and else
## I have also used a different name for the database.
## Also since query is being depreciated, I have used session.excecute and select methods, sometime they have made code a bit complex but they have worked.
## Also used HTML Jinja2 to determine authentication of logged in users than in .py
